Wuhan university - automation extract human body
Canny edge detection operator [8] and Freeman’s 8-connected [6] chain codes are used to represent the silhouette curves

the camera is positioned at 5m distance from the subjects and 1m height from the ground and four images are captured

Silhouette Detection and Contour Representation
- Take a picture without people (background picture)
- Take a picture with people
- Get the differences between background and forground.

- Apply the Freeman's 8-connected to get the body silhouettes. Collect points in front and side image (71 points in all body parts)

The problems:
- We don't hav features points spec, we need to get it by practising.
