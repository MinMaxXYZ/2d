TsingHua university - constructing 3D human model from images

Main steps: 
- Silhouette detection - like wuhan paper
- Feature extraction - like wuhan paper

- Body dimension measurement: 
  + Calculate the body measurement by compute distance between special points.
  + They have the 3D human model database to compare and re correct the shape

- 3D human model construction: They used the commercial software 3D MAXTM and its software development
kit (SDK) MaxscriptTM to build the 3D human model.
